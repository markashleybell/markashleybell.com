CMS-less rebuild of my personal site, using Dropbox to publish blog content and Disqus for comments.

## Publishing

Articles are authored as plain text [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files, which are then retrieved by the site and converted into static HTML files. The custom article file schema supports Title, Date and Abstract fields, which are parsed by the HTML generator.
