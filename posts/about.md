# Hi! My name's Mark. I build websites and web applications.

Computers like me. Well, most of them, anyway—and even if we don’t get on at first, I usually win them over. I speak fluent C#, JavaScript and Python, plus some conversational PHP.

You can see what I'm working on at [GitHub](https://github.com/markashleybell "External Link: GitHub Profile") and ask me questions (or answer mine) at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/43140/mark-bell "External Link: Stack Overflow Profile"). I'm also on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/markashleybell "External Link: LinkedIn Profile"), and if you like a bit of bluesy rock, check out my band [Flood](http://floodband.uk "External Link: Flood").

You can contact me via email at <span id="e">[Turn On Javascript To View Email Address]</span>, or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/markashleybell "External Link: Twitter Profile").
