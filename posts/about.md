# Hi! My name's Mark. I build websites and web applications.

Computers like me. Well, most of them, anyway—and even if we don’t get on at first, I usually win them over. I speak fluent C#, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and Python.

You can see what I'm working on at [GitHub](https://github.com/markashleybell) and 
ask me questions (or answer mine) at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/43140/mark-bell). I'm also on [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/markashleybell) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/markashleybell).
