Title: Test Blog Post

## Here's a sub heading

This is how you should format blog posts. Use the header block above followed by a blank line, then stat your Markdown content.

## Code

You can include code samples too:

    function thisIsCool()
    {
        alert('This is cool!');
    }

Just indent the code by four spaces.

If you want specific language highlighting, you need to specify it by surrounding the code with HTML tags:

<pre><code data-language="javascript">function thisIsCool()
{
	alert('This is cool!');
}</code></pre>

Now I've changed this file, the site should rebuild it.
